#1. Introduction

Laziness and the inability for people to reach/finish goals is something mos of us overlook. We always talk about setting goals,
but people hardly talk about what it takes to finish a goals.

#2. Problem Statement

It can be hard to set goals and stick to them in a whorld full of busy schedules. We tend to have motivation to do thigns only for a short while,
then the motivation dies and we forget how we're planning to execute our goals and plans.

#3. Proposed Solution

Since we all like phones so much, how about an app for setting goals, breaking them up into milestones and sharing them with peers to get advice
and feedback on the goal and its progress.
